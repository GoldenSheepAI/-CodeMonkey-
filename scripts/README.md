Automation scripts for managing the CodeMonkey project.

## Available Scripts

### ðŸš€ setup.sh

**What it creates:**
- `source/integrations/*/types.ts` - Type definitions for each integration

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Initialize git hooks
pnpm prepare

# 4. Run development server
pnpm dev
```

### Before Releasing
```bash
# 1. Run tests
pnpm test

# 2. Build project
pnpm build

# 3. Run release script
./scripts/release.ts patch

# 4. Push changes
git push origin main --tags
```

### After Upgrading
```bash
# Check for pending migrations
./scripts/migrate.ts status

# Run migrations if needed
./scripts/migrate.ts up
```

## Script Permissions

All scripts should be executable. If you encounter permission errors, run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/*.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: pnpm"
Run the setup script - it will install pnpm automatically:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### "permission denied"
Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
```

### "node_modules conflicts"
The setup script cleans old dependencies automatically. If issues persist:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:
1. Make them executable: `chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh`
2. Add usage documentation to this README
3. Include error handling and user feedback
4. Use colored output for better UX
5. Test on clean installations

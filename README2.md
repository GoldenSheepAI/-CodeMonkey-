The old lighthouse keeper found a message in a bottle washed up on shore, written in his own handwriting from thirty years ago. As he read the faded words, he realized he had been sending himself reminders all along to never forget the treasures buried beneath the lighthouse. With trembling hands, he grabbed his old shovel and headed toward the spot he'd marked in the moonlight so many decades before. The first spade of dirt uncovered not gold or jewels, but a small wooden chest containing his childhood diary and the reason he'd become a lighthouse keeper in the first place.
